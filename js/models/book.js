//First, weâ€™ll need a model of a book and a collection to hold the list. These are both //very simple, with the model only declaring some defaults:
// site/js/models/book.js

var app = app || {};

app.Book = Backbone.Model.extend({
    defaults: {
        coverImage: 'img/placeholder.png',
        title: 'No title',
        author: 'Unknown',
        releaseDate: 'Unknown',
        keywords: 'None'
    }
});
